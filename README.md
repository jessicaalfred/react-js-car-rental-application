## Starting üöÄ

These instructions will allow you to get a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Requirements üìã

Software and tools you will need to run this project:

- Java 11 (_tested version_)
- Node v14.17.3 (_tested version_)
- Eclipse
- VS Code (_Reccomended for frontend developement_)

### Local deployment üîß

There are two ways to work in your local environment:

1. Spring-Boot app in port 8080 and React app in port 3000 (_Recommended for development_)
2. Both apps running in port 8080

Let's see how to work with each option.

_Note: both frontend and backend are configured to start on path /projectname. Moreover frontend subpaths follow this pattern: /projectname/#/subpath (due to deployment requirements it is necessary to use HashRouter instead of BrowserRouter)_

**1. Access frontend in port 3030 (_Reccomended for development_)**

- Install your maven project
  ```
  mvn clean install
  ```
- Start backend sever
  ```
  mvn spring-boot:run
  ```
- Install your frontend app (not necessary if mvn install was executed correctly)
  ```
  npm install
  ```
- Start react app
  ```
  npm start
  ```

Now you can test your app in http://localhost:3000/rentberry (frontend)

**2. Access frontend in port 8080**

- Install your maven project
  ```
  mvn clean install
  ```
- Start the application
  `mvn spring-boot:run`
  Thanks to the provided plugin configuration you can access your React app directly on http://localhost:8080/rentberry

## Deployment üì¶

Production deploy will be made via Jenkins to Kubernetes.

Steps to be followed:

1. Build the project
   ```
   mvn clean install
   ```
2. Create docker image
   ```
   mvn k8s:build
   ```
3. Undeploy Kubernetes app (_only needed if app is already deployed_)
   ```
   mvn k8s:undeploy
   ```
4. Push image to GitLab registry
   ```
   mvn k8s:push
   ```
5. Deploy pushed image to Kubernetes
   ```
   # Generate deploy files
   mvn k8s:resource
   # Deploy to Kubernetes
   mvn k8s:deploy
   ```

## Built with üõ†Ô∏è

- [Spring-Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) - Backend
- [React](https://es.reactjs.org/) - User Interface

## Debug

- Just in case if the tomcat fails and says port 8080 alread in use, then open cmd in admin mode and type <br />
 ```
 netstat -ao | find "8080" 
 Taskkill /PID 20712 /F
 ```
